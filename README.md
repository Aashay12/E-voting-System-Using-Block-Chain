This code trains a face recognition model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm. 
It takes pre-computed facial embeddings as input and trains the SVM model to recognize and classify faces based on these embeddings. The trained model and the label encoder used for encoding class labels are then saved to disk for later use in face recognition applications.
